# Why are flowers so expensive?   
## 为何鲜花如此昂贵？  

① Why does something you could just pluck out of the ground cost so much?  

为什么从土里摘出来的花如此昂贵？  

② There are several reasons: flowers are delicate, high maintenance, perishable, difficult to grow, often imported and can cross continents as they make their way from field to florist.  

原因有很多，比如鲜花纤弱易断、保养昂贵、容易枯萎、培育困难，而且很多花是进口品，要跨越多个大洲才能从种植地运到花店。  

③ During the flower industry’s peak period, 12th May - Mother’s Day in nearly 100 countries – you may find yourself grumbling about how much a bouquet costs.  

5月12日是近100个国家的母亲节，鲜花市场迎来销售旺期。每到这种时候，你可能就会抱怨怎么买一束花竟如此昂贵。  

④ But that price tag has to account for the house-of-cards nature of the product: the time and money farmers spend to hit holiday deadlines and the pressure for florists to match supply to demand, or lose out.  

然而，鲜花的标价不得不考虑产品本身容易亏损的性质：为了应节上市，花农要投入大量时间和金钱；花商也面临着巨大的压力，如不能匹配供需比例，就成了赔本买卖。  

⑤ Flowers are moving across continents and since they’re perishable, they have to be refrigerated as they travel, which is expensive.  

因为花卉极易凋谢，所以跨州运输时必须冷冻起来，开销十分昂贵。  

⑥ For florists, it can be risky, because they may order 10,000 tulips in the hope of selling them for a lone event on the calendar, like Mother’s Day.  

对于商家而言，这是有风险的，因为他们可能一次性订购10000朵郁金香，期望在母亲节这样的节假日里一举售磬。  

⑦ But if they don’t sell them all, the leftovers quickly die and become worthless.  

但是卖不掉的鲜花会迅速枯萎，变得一文不值。  

⑧ Part of what consumers are paying for is that risk.  

消费者付的钱里有一部分就是承担了这一风险。
