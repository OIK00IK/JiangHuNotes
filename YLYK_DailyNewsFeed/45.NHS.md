# Hands off our NHS  
## 别碰我们的NHS  

① British politicians don’t find much to agree on these days.  

现如今，英国的政客们几乎找不到什么能达成一致意见的事情了。  

② But mention the National Health Service, as President Donald Trump did on Tuesday, and the country unites in one voice: Hands off our NHS.  

不过，就像美国总统唐纳德·特朗普上周二那样，但凡有人提到国家医疗服务体系 (NHS) ，整个国家就会众口一词：别碰我们的NHS。  

③ Britain’s healthcare system is free at the point of delivery for everyone in the UK and has been since after the end of World War Two.  

自二战以后至今，在英国医疗服务体系下，英国境内的所有人在接受医疗服务时不需支付任何费用。  

④ Over the years, it has become a cherished national institution, immune from criticism. Whenever governments plan to introduce charges, or suggest private investment, it inevitably causes an uproar.  

多年以来，它已经成为了一项备受珍视的国家制度，鲜有人横加指责。每当政府计划征收费用，引入私营资本，都会不可避免地引起一片哗然。  

⑤ The trouble is, pressures on the NHS are increasing. An aging population, demand for more expensive treatments, and a public spending squeeze, give politicians little room for manoeuvre.  

问题在于，NHS所负担的压力越来越重了。人口老龄化问题、对更昂贵治疗的需求以及公共开支的缩减，使政客们捉襟见肘，束手无策。  

⑥ American healthcare companies spot an opening. The NHS needs investment and after Brexit, Britain wants a trade deal with the US.  

美国的医疗保健公司发现了机遇。脱欧之后，NHS急需投资，而英国又想与美国达成一项贸易协定。  

⑦ Since its inception in 1948, the NHS has become an integral part of British society and the country’s biggest employer.  

自1948年设立以来，NHS已成为英国社会不可或缺的一部分，也是英国最大的用人单位。  

⑧ No politician, not even the world’s most powerful one, is allowed to tamper with the NHS.  

任何政客，即使是最位高权重者，都不能干涉NHS，就算是世界上最强势的那个也不行。

##  ▍Facts

1. The NHS is the first universal healthcare system in the world.   
   
   Even in the very beginning, the NHS had problems. The biggest problem from the very beginning and still today is simply finding enough money to pay for it.   

2. How much does the NHS cost?   

   Just in England, not including Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the NHS costs approximately 125 billion pounds per year.   
   
   Experts agree that we should be spending an extra 20 billion pounds per year just to maintain, just to keep the same level of service.   

3. Not every part of British healthcare is free.   
   
   You go to the doctor, anyone, that is free. Now if you need medicine, the doctor will give you a special form, and you take that to the chemist, and then we pay for the medicine that the doctor has recommended.   

   Most people pay for medicine. But medicine is free for children under 16, people aged 16 to 18 who are still in full-time education, people with low income, people over 65, women who are pregnant, or women who  have had a baby in the last 12 months, or people with some serious permanent diseases which require daily medicine such as diabetes.  

4. What can the British do in the future to save their NHS?   
   
   In a recent survey, about 50 per cent of the British population support a tax increase to improve the NHS.   

   But, politically, this is a dangerous topic. The government could charge more tax to increase spending on the NHS, but it’s risky – they risk losing many voters.   

5. What is the future of the NHS?   
   
   Right now Brexit is the biggest problem facing the NHS. The NHS employs about 1.5 million people, and 160,000 of those people are not British. These are often skilled medical staff; it’s very difficult to replace  them.  

   After Brexit, the UK will leave this group called the EMA, the European Medicines Agency, where EU countries share research, medicine and knowledge of new medicines. And they sell medicines to each other.   

   There’s no easy solution for the NHS. Brexit is going to cause many, many problems for the NHS. The NHS doesn’t have enough money, and it looks like the British government doesn’t have a solution to find more money for the NHS.
