# Theresa May resigns after Brexit failure  
## “脱欧”折戟，特雷莎·梅辞职

随着特雷莎·梅泪眼婆娑地宣布辞职，她最终放弃了实现“脱欧”之战，保守党将因此迎来混乱的党魁之争，无协议脱欧的可能性也随之增加。

在保守党任命新领袖之前，梅姨将以代理首相的身份继续任职。

⑤ The Brexit saga has consumed Mrs May and her party.  

“脱欧”这场大戏已经使梅姨及其政党心力交瘁。

她的“脱欧”协议在下议院三度遇挫，致使英国自原定“脱欧”日期3月29日以来，已两次延期脱离欧盟。  

⑦ Mrs May admitted on the steps of Number 10 that she had been defeated by the challenge of delivering Brexit.  

站在唐宁街10号的台阶上，梅姨坦言自己已被实现“脱欧”这一挑战击败。
