# Pay by cash? Not for long, report warns
## 报告预警：现金付款“大限”将至？
① The system allowing people to use cash in the UK is at risk of falling apart and needs a new guarantee to ensure notes and coins can still be used.   

允许人们在英国使用现金的体系正面临着瓦解的风险，政府需要出台新的措施以确保纸钞和硬币仍然可以使用。  

② A hard-hitting review by finance experts has concluded that market forces will not save cash for as long as people need it.  

几位金融专家撰写了一份一针见血的评论，断言市场力量并不会因人们仍有需要而拯救现金。  

③ Cash use has been falling dramatically in recent years. In 2017, debit card use - driven by contactless payments - overtook the number of payments made in cash in the UK for the first time.  

近几年来，现金的使用急剧减少。2017年，在无接触式支付的驱动下，英国人使用借记卡付款的次数首次超过了使用现金的次数。  

④ The demise of cash, if unchecked, would be driven primarily by retailers and other businesses refusing to accept cash owing to the cost of handling it. The report said that the current rate of decline would mean cash use would end in 2026. It also calls on the government and regulators to step in to ensure cash remains viable.  

如果不想办法抑制，现金可能就此消亡，这主要是因为许多零售商和其他企业都因收银成本而拒收现金。该报告称，现在的消减速度意味着，2026年将没有人使用现金。该报告还呼吁政府和监管机构插手干预，以确保现金的使用能维持下去。  

⑤ Evidence from Sweden, seen as much closer to a cashless society than the UK, suggested that infrastructure was needed before cash use declined beyond anyone's control.  

瑞典被公认为比英国更接近无现金社会，而来自瑞典的证据表明，在现金使用的消减趋势无法控制之前，需要先建设好相应的基础设施。
