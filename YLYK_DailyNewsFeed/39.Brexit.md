# What do the EU elections mean for Brexit? It’s complicated

# What do the EU elections mean for Brexit? It’s complicated  
## 欧洲议会选举对脱欧意味着什么？一言难尽  

① The Conservatives turned in their worst electoral performance since 1832. Labour managed to finish third in Wales and a remarkable fifth in Scotland.  

保守党交出了他们自1832年以来最糟糕的选举成绩。工党在威尔士的得票率屈居第三，在苏格兰更是跌至第五，让人大跌眼镜。  

② Meanwhile, the Lib Dems have rediscovered their mojo and the Brexit party has taken on and beaten all comers from a standing start.  

与此同时，自由民主党重新焕发生机，而“白手起家”的脱欧党则迎头直上，击败了所有对手。  

③ The two big parties – Labour and Conservative – haemorrhaged votes. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats picked up an impressive 20% of the vote – their best ever European performance.  

工党和保守党这两大政党经历了选票滑铁卢。同时，自由民主党出乎意料地拿下了20%的选票，这是他们在欧洲议会选举中的历史最佳表现。  

④ And last but not least was of course the Brexit party. Whatever one thinks of its leader it is hard not to be impressed by the way Nigel Farage propelled his troops to outright victory, insisting on the need for a “clean” (no-deal) exit from the EU.  

最后当然不得不提脱欧党。无论你怎样看待该党党魁奈杰尔·法拉奇，他执意主张 “净身”（无协议）脱欧，率领部众大获全胜，委实令人钦佩。  

⑤ The shocking performances of the two big parties means that one possible way out of this bottleneck – a general election – is less likely than it was.  

两大党派令人难以置信的表现意味着，打破脱欧瓶颈的一个潜在方式——也就是一次大选——可能性越来越低了。  

⑥ The one thing that Conservative and Labour MPs want less than Brexit gridlock is an early encounter with the same electorate that just issued them such a severe punishment.  

相比脱欧僵局，保守党和工党议员们更不想刚刚惨遭如此重创，又在提前大选中与同一批选民狭路相逢。

## ▍Background Information

1. What are the European/EU elections?

    The European/EU elections are used to choose members of the European Parliament.

    The European/EU elections happen every five years. The last one was last week, and the one before that was 2014.

    There are 751 members of the European Parliament and these members of the European Parliament, MEPs, represent the 28 nations, including the UK, of the EU. So all 28 countries in the EU must select and send their politicians to sit on the European Parliament.

    The European/EU elections are different to the domestic general elections. All 28 countries hold their own domestic elections to choose their own domestic governments, and these are usually called General Elections.

2. What does the European Parliament do?

    The European Parliament has the power to pass something called EU laws, and all the member countries must follow these EU laws.

    EU laws can relate to issues like workers' rights, citizens' rights, consumer protection, as well as things like energy, environmental issues, agricultural policy, and fishing policy.

    It has no power in things like domestic health services, education, schools, housing. Each individual member country can control all of these things themselves in their own country.
