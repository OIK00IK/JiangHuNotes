# Is Hollywood’s love of sequels destroying cinema?   
## 好莱坞痴迷电影续集正在摧毁电影行业？  

① Never before have film sequels been so popular.  

电影续集从未像现在这般受欢迎。  

② In their early days, sequels were mainly cheap B-pictures churned out to reuse sets, costumes and props.  

早期，为了重复利用之前的场景、服装和道具，电影制作商炮制了大量画面劣质的电影续集。  

③ Now, each new movie in a series grows bigger and costlier.  

而现在，每一部全新的系列电影的新作都变得越来越规模庞大且耗资不菲。  

④ The industry’s eagerness to recycle is not hard to explain.  

电影行业如此热衷炒冷饭并不难解释。  

⑤ Of the all-time top 10 grossing films, six are now sequels – all released in the last four years.  

在有史以来最吸金10部电影中，有6部是续集，而且都是近四年内上映的。  

⑥ More important than the scale of these earnings is their reliability - the success of a sequel is virtually guaranteed.  

与盈利规模相比，更重要的是电影续集的可靠性，因为它们基本都能获得成功。  

⑦ Just why sequels are so successful is no mystery either.  

电影续集能够大获成功也并不稀奇。  

⑧ They are less risky to make, because all involved know exactly what they are dealing with, and they also meet intense audience demand.  

首先，它们的制作风险更低，因为制作方对制作内容早已轻车熟路；其次，它们能满足观影人群的强烈需求。  

⑨ Huge fanatical fanbases will keenly await each new instalment of an established franchise.  

对于知名系列电影的每部新作品，庞大的狂热粉丝群体们总是翘首以待。  

⑩ However, the sequels juggernaut is throttling fresh ideas, the lifeblood of any creative activity.  

然而，强大的电影续集市场正在扼杀新的奇思妙想，而这正是所有创意活动的源泉。  

⑪ Franchises thrill fans and enrich studios. But in a fast-changing world, familiar comforts may be more harmful than we think.  

诚然，系列电影令粉丝们激动不已，也让电影公司们赚的盆满钵满。但在如今这样一个瞬息万变的世界里，只是大同小异的慰藉或许比我们想象的更具破坏力。  

⑫ Children find it consoling to be told the same bedtime story every night. Maybe, however, it is time for filmgoers to grow up.  

对于孩子们来说，每晚聆听同样的睡前故事会非常安心。但对于影迷们而言，也许现在是时候长大了。
