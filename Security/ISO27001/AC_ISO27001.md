## Need for Information Security at Accenture
Information and all supporting processes, systems, and networks are important business assets. Defining, achieving, maintaining, and improving information security are essential in ensuring a competitive edge, cash flow, profitability, legal compliance, and commercial image of the organization.  

Sharing information is a common feature in Accenture’s businesses. The availability, integrity, and confidentiality of information is critical for the continued success of the organization.

Technological advancements, such as the Internet and mobile devices, have their own security issues. Our working practices also create additional security challenges, such as home/client site working, use of third parties, and so on.

Ensuring security of Accenture’s information assets is essential for maintaining the confidentiality of our data, as well as that of our client’s, and most importantly, to protect our reputation in the marketplace.

IT security and data protection are among the top ten risks that pose a challenge to Accenture, based on our Enterprise Risk Management Framework. 

The IT security helps drive customer confidence in Accenture brand and provides an assurance to Accenture's stakeholders. It also protects Accenture’s advantages over its competitors.
